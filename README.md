# hg-icons

This is a collection of icons used in the Hugeicons project.

I created this library to streamline my workflow. Previously, I had to manually copy and paste icons from the Hugeicons website into my projects, which was time-consuming.

## Installation

```bash
npm install hg-icons

yarn add hg-icons

pnpm add hg-icons

bun add hg-icons
```

## Usage

```tsx
// For filled icons:
import { Github01IconFill } from "hg-icons/fill";

// For stroke icons:
import { Github01Icon } from "hg-icons/stroke";
```

```tsx
// With Tailwind CSS:
<Github01IconFill className="w-4 h-4" />
<Github01Icon className="w-4 h-4" />
```
